# hemm

The goal of `{hemm}` is to (try) to provide advices on obscure R error messages. 

## Disclaimer

The messages returned by `{hemm}` try to explain what the error is. There is no guarantee they succeed. 

So far, there are `r nrow(read.csv("inst/en_errors.csv"))` errors analysed.


## Installation

You can install the dev version of {hemm} with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ColinFay/hemm")
```

## Launch {hemm}

``` r
library(hemm)
init_hemm()
```

Wait for an error to occure:

``` r
> iri
Error: object 'iri' not found
hemm...
The object you are looking for might not exist. 

> iri()
Error in iri() : could not find function "iri"
hemm...
You might have forgotten to load a package or have mispelled the function name. 

Error in mean$plop : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
hemm...
You might have called `$` on a function. 
 
> "a" + "b"
Error in "a" + "b" : non-numeric argument to binary operator
hemm...
You might have tried to use a character vector where a numeric is needed. 

> library(dlypr)
Error in library(dlypr) : there is no package called ‘dlypr’
hemm...
You might have forgotten to install a package or have mispelled the package name 

...
```
## Stop `{hemm}`

``` r
stop_hemm()
```

## Contribute

You can contribute by: 

+ adding examples into the [inst/en_errors.csv](inst/en_errors.csv) csv of errors. On each line, the first element is a regex that catches the error, the other is a message (trying) to explain the error.
